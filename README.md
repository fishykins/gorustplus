This is an **unofficial** Golang library for interacting with Smart Switches, Smart Alarms and various other things in the PC game [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/).

Websocket interactions were first documented in [Rustplus](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js), and the utility scripts provided are the best way to listen for device ids etc. Big props to Liam!
